# Support Vector Machine
## Description
This project implements Support Vector Machine algorithm to classify data using different kernels(linear, polynomia and RBF).
## Installation
Follow the below steps to set up the project :
1. Download all the files in library "Problem 2"
2. Download the matlab code "shoesDucks.m" & dataset "shoesducks.mat" 
3. Place all the files in one working folder/directory
## Usage
Run the matlab code and it will load the dataset and run the Support Vector Machine algorithm using the SGD. The code also retruns plots for error corrsponding to various values of polynomial degrees in Polynomial kernel and for error corrsponding to various values of sigma(standard deviations) in RBF kernel. Plots returned by the code are like as below :

Error corresponding to different polynomial degrees
